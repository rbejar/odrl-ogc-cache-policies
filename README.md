odrl-ogc-cache-policies
=======================
An experimental implementation of a protocol for machine-readable cache policies in OGC and ISO geoservices.
The protocol is described in this paper: 
[A protocol for machine-readable cache policies in OGC web services: Application to the EuroGeoSource information system](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.06.026). If you do not have access to the full document, the author's final version (with almost exactly the same content) is available at <http://iaaa.cps.unizar.es/curriculum/08-Publicaciones-Articulos/art_2014_EMS_Protocol_vdef_author.pdf>.

A protocol for machine-readable cache policies in OGC web services: Application to the EuroGeoSource information system.  R. BÃ‰JAR, F.J. LOPEZ-PELLICER, J. NOGUERAS-ISO, F.J. ZARAZAGA-SORIA, P.R. MURO-MEDRANO.  Environmental Modelling & Software.  2014,  vol. 60,  p. 346-356, doi:10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.06.026.

Take into consideration that this code is not robust or production-ready; it is an experiment to test if the mentioned protocol can be implemented as proposed, and to show how that could be done.

Instructions
============
You need a Python 2.7.x interpreter to run this program. It has been developed and tested in Python 2.7.3 in Linux, 
but it should run in any other platform that supports Python 2.7.x 

Besides a number of Python 2.7 standard libraries, you need OWSLib 0.8.7, which allows to use OGC services
from Python code. You can find out more information about this library (including the license terms) in
<https://geopython.github.io/OWSLib/>. I have included the sources of this library in the repository to make
it easier to clone and test this, but that is clearly a quick-and-dirty solution.

On Linux, you can clone the repository locally with this command:

`git clone https://github.com/rbejar/odrl-ogc-cache-policies`

After that, you can give ODRL_Paper.py file run permission and
then run it:

    cd odrl-ogc-cache-policies
    chmod u+x ODRL_Paper.py
    ./ODRL_Paper.py
    
As long as you have Python 2.7.x installed, this will work. This is
the result of a run of this program:

About the WFS services
======================
Three OGC WFS services have been set up using [Geoserver](http://geoserver.org/) to test the protocol 
(ODRL_Paper.py reads their capabilities to extract the ODRL licenses as the protocol requires). Creating 
an OGC web service with Geoserver that uses the protocol is simple: you set it up as usual with the
Geoserver web administration tool, and right there you include the text you want in the *Acess Constraints*
section. As long as that text includes an URL with a valid ODRL file (that can be hosted wherever you 
prefer), you are ready.

These are the three capabilites files (static, not coming from an actual WFS services; this is not relevant to the test because it does not request anything else from the services):

- <https://rbejar.github.io/odrl-ogc-cache-policies/TestODRL1_Capabilities.xml>
- <https://rbejar.github.io/odrl-ogc-cache-policies/TestODRL2_Capabilities.xml> 
- <https://rbejar.github.io/odrl-ogc-cache-policies/TestODRL3_Capabilities.xml>

And these are the three ODRL license files that are linked from the *Access Constraints* section on those
capabilities (hosted on github.io, but they could be anywhere):

- <https://rbejar.github.io/odrl-ogc-cache-policies/odrl1.xml>
- <https://rbejar.github.io/odrl-ogc-cache-policies/odrl2.xml>
- <https://rbejar.github.io/odrl-ogc-cache-policies/odrl3.xml>
